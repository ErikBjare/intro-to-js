# Introduction to JavaScript using Canvas

This is an introduction to JavaScript aimed at first year (and later) CS students.
It will be the boilerplate for the 2nd lecture I hold for Code@LTH which will be held on the 10th september 2015.

There will also be a jsfiddle, because everyone might not be familiar with Git and it's magic and jsfiddle is simply easier (even though they could just get a zip archive).
