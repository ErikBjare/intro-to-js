# Introduction to JavaScript using Canvas

This is an introduction to JavaScript aimed at first year (and later) CS students.
It will be the boilerplate for the 2nd lecture I hold for Code@LTH which will be held on the 10th september 2015.

There will also be a simpler jsfiddle, because everyone might not be familiar with Git and it's magic and jsfiddle is simply easier (even though they could just get a zip archive).

Try making a game, some cool geometry or whatever brilliant idea your imagination comes up with!

**If you are already somewhat familiar with JS, or can infer how it works, check out [this cheat-sheet](http://cheatsheetworld.com/programming/html5-canvas-cheat-sheet/).**

Here are a few learning resources:
 - [HTML5 Canvas Tutorials](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/)
 - [A reference of all methods available on the context/'canvas' variable](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp)
 - [Phaser, a game development framework for canvas](http://phaser.io/)

And here is a list of cool things you can try to make:
 - [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
 - [Pythagoras Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal))

And here are a few things already made:
 - [Badass animation](https://jsfiddle.net/gg19b2do/4/)
 - [A Game of Life implementation using canvas](http://erik.bjareholt.com/GameOfLife/)
